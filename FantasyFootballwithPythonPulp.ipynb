    "To start playing [Fantasy Premiere League](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/a/squad/selection), we need to select 15 Premiere League football players within a budget of £100m. The players must consist of 2 goalkeepers, 5, defenders, 5 midfielders, and 3 forwarders. Each player has total score that shows how good he is. How would you come up with the best combination of players that will win the game?\n",
