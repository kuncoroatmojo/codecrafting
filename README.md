### [Fantasy Football Squad Optimization](https://github.com/kuncoroatmojo/codecrafting/blob/master/FantasyFootballwithPythonPulp.ipynb)
My friends invited me to join Fantasy Premier League. In this game you can create a team and join a league with a group of friends or an online community. Sounds cool!

First I need to select the players to be in my team. Using the Â£100m budget, I need to pick 15 players out of hundreds of players available. The team consists of 2 goalkeepers, 5 defenders, 5 midfielders, 3 forwards. Sounds like a mathematical optimization to me!
